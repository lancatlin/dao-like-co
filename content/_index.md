## What is LikeCoin

As a DeBook (Decentralized Book) protocol designed to revolutionize book publishing, LikeCoin empowers authors with immutable content metadata, persistent storage (IPFS/Arweave), and fairer revenue share, while readers become curators, stakeholders and may participate in governance. The core is the $LIKE token (ERC-20 on Base), which readers own and can stake on books to endorse them, influencing their ranking and discoverability. Also, $LIKE holders may participate in proposal voting. Stakers share in book sale income, aligning incentives between creators and consumers. This fosters a community-driven literary ecosystem where books, as NFTs, are co-curated and co-monetized.
